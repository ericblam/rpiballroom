    <h2>Dinner and Dancing - The After Party!</h2>
    <p><i><b>Saturday, March 22, 2014</b></i></p>
    <p>This year we're keeping it super casual again!  We're going to order a bunch of pizzas, etc. - those of you who have to drive home after the competition will have a chance to get a little something to eat without having to go anywhere!  We'll be collecting dinner RSVPs during the day, so be sure to sign up!  (And I'm sure we'll have music going and there will be some social dancing, as well!)  </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h2>Lessons and Workshops</h2>
    <p><i><b>Sunday, March 23, 2014</b></i></p>

    <p><b>10:00 AM - <i>"Critique and Technique For the Competitor"</i> with Bobbi Daives!</b><br />
      Even if you are not a competitive dancer, this is still a GREAT opportunity for those of you who would like to work on your dancing technique a little more.
    </p>
    <p><b>10:45 AM - <i>"I've Got Rhythm"</i> with Pamela Kazimir!</b><br />
      Pamela has a wonderful program prepared for us!  She's going to be reviewing some Rhythm technique and helping us spice things up on the dance floor!
    </p>
    <p><b>11:30 AM - <i>"Smooth Criminal"</i> with Iraida Volodina and Ricardo Sopin!</b><br />
      Iraida and Ricardo will be coming back again this year to shake things up a little!  They will cover the technique for a few of the Smooth dances and work on how to add a little character to our dancing.
