<p>* As of now, open/pre-champ events will be held after their respective syllabus events (e.g. open standard will be held after the syllabus standard events and prior to the syllabus smooth events.) Please stay tuned throughout registration, this may change based on number of open registrations. </p>
<p>* Schedule may be adjusted depending on the number of registered couples for each style.  Be sure to check back for a more accurate schedule as we get closer to the competition - a final schedule will be set by Wednesday, April 4th.</p>
<p>Competitors should be prepared to compete 30 minutes prior to the scheduled sections, in the event that the competition runs early.</p>
