<p>Registration fees will be waived for all Open/Pre-Champ competitors (i.e. competitors that are only competing at the Open/Pre-Champ level; excludes those double registering and those dancing at Gold for selected styles.)</p>
<!--<p>For competitors that do not wish to compete all events in each style, they may also opt to select individual events at a cost of $5 per event with a $10 base charge.</p>-->
<p>Money must be submitted before the competitor may compete (i.e. the day of the competition) although as soon as possible is better!</p>
<p>Payment can be cash or checks (made out to RPI Ballroom) and can be mailed to:<br />
  RPI Ballroom<br />
  c/o Kuwabo Mubyana<br />
  110 8th Street<br />
  RU 3716<br />
  Troy, NY 12180</p>
<p>Confirmed withdrawal prior to April 5, 2018 is required for refund or to be exempt from payment. Additional exceptions are at the discretion of the competition coordinator.</p>

<h3> TBA Requests </h3>
<p>We know how hard it can be to find partners. This year, we are introducing a more formalized TBA 
system. If you need a TBA partner, go ahead and register for the competition. Then request a TBA partner, 
ahead of time, by filling out <a target="_blank" href= "https://goo.gl/forms/tFKg1UlugZo6IqT53"> this form</a>. 
</p>

<p> The earlier you can submit a TBA request, the better! Any individuals who submit TBA requests early 
may be paired with a TBA partner before the competition. If you are not contacted (by e-mail) with your 
TBA pairing, come and see us early at the check-in desk on the day of the competition. We will find you 
a partner! </p>
