<!--<p>For competitors that do not wish to compete all events in each style, they may also opt to select individual events at a cost of $5 per event with a $10 base charge.</p>-->
<p>Money must be submitted before the competitor may compete (i.e. the day of the competition) although as soon as possible is better!</p>
<p>Payment can be cash or checks (made out to RPI Ballroom) and can be mailed to:<br />

  c/o Sarah McRae<br />
  110 8th Street<br />

<p>Confirmed withdrawal prior to February 24th is required for refund or to be exempt from payment. Additional exceptions are at the discretion of the competition coordinator.</p>

<h3> TBA Requests </h3>
<p>We are continuing to use a more formalized TBA system. If you need a TBA partner, please register for the competition. Then request a TBA partner 
ahead of time by filling out <a target="_blank" href= "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfio4NerdRDQjZRhWqZERvtmXPecL-68ljWJ1wEvoi11OkA1g/viewform?usp=sf_link"> this form</a>. <!-- NO DEADLINE FOR TBA. #endcomment #startmessage by <strong>April 1st</strong>. -->
</p>
<!-- <p>More information coming soon.</p> -->

<!--8/30/2019 <p> The earlier you can submit a TBA request, the better! Any individuals who submit TBA requests early 
may be paired with a TBA partner before the competition. If you are not contacted (by e-mail) with your 
TBA pairing, come and see us early at the check-in desk on the day of the competition. We will find you 
a partner! </p> -->
