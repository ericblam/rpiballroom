    <p>RPI Ballroom is a growing organization, always striving to maintain the high level of quality that provides rewarding and meaningful experiences for our students. We are active on several fronts: providing instruction to 100+ members, coordinating community dance events, and actively competing at various regional DanceSport competitions. The Rensselaer Student Union is instrumental in providing funds that allow RPI Ballroom to pursue its programs, but we could always use help in our efforts to expand our membership base and enrich the RPI community.</p>
<p>Whatever you can do to help, be it a monetary donation or offering us competition costumes, we will be grateful.</p>
