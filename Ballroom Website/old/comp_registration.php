    <h4>The 2013 RPI Dancesport Competition results are in!</h4>
    <p>Thank you to everyone for another wonderful competition this past spring!  After a little difficulty with our Registrar, we are happy to provide you with the Results!</p>

    <p>These were tallied manually from the judges score sheets by team members, instead.   We apologize in advance for any mistakes in final placements - we aren't professional scrutineers, but we did our best!  If you notice discrepancies please contact <a href="mailto:rpicompcoordinator@gmail.com"><?php echo($comp_coordinator)?></a> and we'll make the appropriate changes.</p>
    <p>Again, thank you for all of your patience and we apologize for the delay.</p>
