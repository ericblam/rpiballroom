<p>Registration fees will be waived for all Open/Pre-Champ competitors (i.e. competitors that are only competing at the Open/Pre-Champ level; excludes those double registering and those dancing at Gold for selected styles.)</p>
<!--<p>For competitors that do not wish to compete all events in each style, they may also opt to select individual events at a cost of $5 per event with a $10 base charge.</p>-->
<p>Money must be submitted before the competitor may compete (i.e. the day of the competition) although as soon as possible is better!</p>
<p>Payment can be cash or checks (made out to RPI Ballroom) and can be mailed to:<br />
  RPI Ballroom<br />
  c/o Eric Lam<br />
  110 8th Street<br />
  RU 3716<br />
  Troy, NY 12180</p>
<p>Confirmed withdrawal prior to March 23, 2017 is required for refund or to be exempt from payment. Additional exceptions are at the discretion of the competition coordinator.</p>
