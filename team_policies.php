<h1 class="title">RPI Ballroom Team Policies</h1>
<p>These Team Policies are in place and enforced in order to ensure that each member of the RPI Ballroom Team has the best experience possible. Exceptions can and will be made as deemed necessary by the Team Captains.</p>

<h3>Who Can Join?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    RPI students may join with no restrictions, so long as they pay both Club and Team dues.
  </li>
  <li>
    Community members (anyone who is not an RPI student) may join, so long as they pay both Club and Team dues, and <b>provided they contribute to the Team in some way</b>.
    <ul>
      <li>
	Community members may not join the Team purely for the practice space and thus must give back in some way. "Contributing" to the Team can be done in the form of attending Club/Team lessons regularly, mentoring other Team members in dances and styles that the community member in question is proficient in, doing miscellaneous work such as cleaning or organizing (arranged by the Captains), or any other form of contribution deemed acceptable by the Captains.
      </li>

</ul>

<h4>Who needs to pay:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    To use any of these resources, one must be a <b>current</b> team member.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the case of an inactive/non-RPI Ballroom Team member, he/she may utilize practice time, private lessons, and workshops, if he/she is accompanied by a current team member. Team lessons are reserved for dues-paying Team members only.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Lessons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Regular Team lessons will be held in the American style dances.
  </li>
  <li>
    Attendance is not mandatory but strongly recommended, you can only learn by doing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose your own commitment level, but know the more you practice the better you dance :)
  </li>
  <li>
    Please attend classes at, or below, your level.
    <ul>
      <li>
	To be eligible to participate in Silver class, please have at least 3 semesters on team, or be close to pointing out of bronze (4+ YCN) points in Bronze
      </li>
      <li>
	Taking general Team classes or classes below your level can still be useful! Going over the basics and technique is something that every dancer can work on, whether they are a brand new newcomer or a seasoned professional.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Be present when you are present (if you're too tired or busy to dance, don't worry about missing class now and again)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Practice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Practicing is not mandatory, but helpful! Any given dancer's performance is affected by their practice habits; a naturally talented dancer may not look polished without practice, or a less naturally talented dancer may perform very well because they practiced a lot. Every dancer can choose their own commitment level and decide when they want to practice; they should do what is best for themselves.
  </li>
  <li>
    Practice is allowed and encouraged during any Open Practice event on the calendar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Practice time can be used individually, with a partner, with a mentor, or with a group, and can be used to work on anything ballroom dance-related.
  </li>
  <li>
    Social dances are not intended to replace practices, they are for social dancing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Appropriate footwear needs to be worn in the studio at all times. This includes:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Socks
      </li>
      <li>
	Dance sneakers
      </li>
      <li>
	Ballroom or Latin heels
      </li>
      <li>
	Ballet/jazz shoes
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Competition</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Team members are not required to compete: it is completely optional. While it is a great experience and can be very enjoyable, it is absolutely okay to join the Team simply for the lessons.
  </li>
  <li>
    Team members may choose to spectate at competitions as well, rather than dance.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is not required that any person travels with the Team, but if attending a competition, it is required that the Team Captains be made aware of each Team member's travel plans in a timely manner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partnerships cannot be set until dancers are at a Silver level. Preferences can be stated at sign-ups for competitions, and the Captains will try to the best of their ability to honor them. However, before partnerships are set, do not expect to always be with your preferred partner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Costumes may be borrowed from the cage for competitions, but must be returned in a timely manner so that the costumes can be made available for other people.
    <ul>
      <li>
	Please return costumes in the condition that you found them or better.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    At competitions, be aware that each and every RPI Ballroom Team member present is representing RPI. Things to be aware of include and are not limited to: excessive public displays of affection, talking about other couples or teams in offensive ways, many Team members sleeping on the floor, and rowdy behavior.
  </li>
</ul>
