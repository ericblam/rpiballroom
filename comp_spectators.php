<h2>What is a ballroom competition? How does it work?</h2>
<p>Dancers from all over the northeast come to ballroom competitions to compete in many different styles of dance. There are the Smooth/Standard dances like Waltz and Foxtrot and there are Rhythm/Latin dances such as Cha Cha and Swing.</p>
<p>Couples dance alongside other dancers of their level and are judged by a panel of judges who call them back to next rounds.</p>
<p>Best part? You see wonderful dancing and great dresses.</p>
<p>Cheer on your friends! Come have a blast! <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/TzczdGAAp5y9u1wj2">Reserve tickets today!</a></p>
