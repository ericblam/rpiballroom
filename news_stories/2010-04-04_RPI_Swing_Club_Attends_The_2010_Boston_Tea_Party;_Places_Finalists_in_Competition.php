    <p>While the rest of the students at <a href="http://rpi.edu">RPI</a> were rounding the final lap of their school week in anticipation of the weekend's parties last Thursday, the <a href="<?php echo($PAGE_PATH);?>swing">RPI Swing Club</a> was getting revved up for a different kind of party. That night, the club made its way to Danvers, Massachusetts, to kick off the annual Boston Tea Party-a four-day event consisting of dancing, dancing, and more dancing.</p>
<p><a href="http://teapartyswings.com">The Boston Tea Party (BTP)</a> showcases the two most prevalent forms of swing: Lindy Hop and West Coast Swing. Lindy Hop is the original and more traditional form of swing, developing from the Charleston in the late 1920s. West Coast is a derivate of Lindy Hop, often characterized by smoother movement and contemporary styling. </p>
<p>"Boston Tea Party is one of the best annual competition events," says Ellie Hanus, RPI's former Lindy Hop instructor of two years. "It's really the place to find top notch competitions, and unlike any other event, a competition where the Lindy Hoppers and West Coast Swing dancers cross over to dance with each other."</p>
<p>During the weekend, the dancers had the opportunity to pick up new moves from over 80 workshops, let loose at social dances, compete in a list of partnered competitions, and enjoy a show from some of the best swing dancers in the world. Although RPI Swing Club members are primarily Lindy Hoppers, the weekend introduced them to such dances as Balboa and the Collegiate Shag.</p>
<p>"It is often hard to obtain new material when the only Lindy Hop scene in Albany is here on RPI's campus. Everyone who went [to BTP] was able to see an improvement in their dancing over the course of three days and had a blast," says Swing Club Treasurer Katie Murdock ('11).</p>
<p>The swing dance workshop/competition event draws over 1400 dancers from throughout the world and with backgrounds as varied as the dances themselves. RPI counted itself among three swing clubs representing their alma maters, the other two being from Rochester Institute of Technology and Pennsylvania State University. </p>
<p>Eight RPI dancers competed in the Novice Lindy Hop Jack and Jill competition. In a Jack and Jill competition, dancers are randomly paired with three different partners with whom they share three dances in a display of improvised dancing. Dancing among 60-plus couples, three RPI students went through to the final competition. By coincidence, coeds Gabrielle Doyon ('11) and Orian Breaux ('12) placed 12th dancing together, while Sarah Boyd ('12) placed 9th with her partner, Ben Kohler of Baltimore.</p>
<p>The competition proved meaningful for all of RPI's participants. "Despite not making it to the finals," says entrant Matthew Shiroma ('13), "the experience I gained by dancing with other people has improved not only my dancing skills, but my abilities to interact with people who have different backgrounds and, in the end, still accomplish a common goal."</p>
<p>The RPI Swing Club offers lessons in Lindy Hop every Wednesday at 8 p.m. and holds open practices every Monday at 8 p.m. in Academy Hall SAR.
