<p>This past Friday, September 7th, the Ballroom Club held its annual Fall Intro Dance!</p>

<p>We kicked off the night with a lesson in Lindy Hop, followed by Argentine Tango, and then wrapped up the evening with a little Salsa dancing from the Ballroom &amp; Latin branch of the club!  With roughly 100 students in attendance, it turned out to be an incredibly fun evening!  </p>
<p>We had three brief lessons, to give everyone a taste of what they can expect from this semester's classes, followed by some open dancing.  During the open dancing, we just threw on some music so everyone could try out there new moves and we also had a few impromptu hustle, jitterbug, and rumba lessons on the side!  </p>

<p>All in all?  An awesome evening!</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing all of you at lessons!</p>
