    <p>Welcome back to school everyone! We hope that the first week of classes has been treating you well. Today is RPI's Activities Fair and we will be there! Come on out and meet us. Sign up to our email lists if you already haven't.</p>
    <p>In other news, though, our biannual Intro Dance will be on Friday, September 12th in the McNeil Room at the Union! Dancing is free, no experience is required, and you don't need a partner! Just come on out, we'll teach you how to get your groove on, and enjoy! Make sure to join us on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/1452755185003325/">Facebook event page</a>.</p>
    <p>Get ready to be sexy, smooth, silly, suave, you name it!</p>
