    <h3>How much does it cost to join?</h3>
    <p>If you are an RPI student, $60 grants you access to all Argentine Tango, Lindy Hop Swing, and Ballroom/Latin lessons per semester ($100 for the whole year).  The membership fee is $85 for non-RPI students ($150 per year).  Joining the Ballroom Team is an additional fee of $25 per semester.  (With 2 Argentine Tango, 2 Lindy Hop Swing, and 3 Ballroom &amp; Latin Lessons available each week, membership opens you up to a total of 30 lessons each semester, so you definitely get your money's worth!)</p>

    <h3>What happens if I miss a lesson?</h3>
    <p>Although we do not recommend missing lessons, there is no long-term penalty if you miss one or two.  Our instructors frequently review learned material, building on past classes, so you will be able to pick it up then.</p>
    <h3>Do I need previous ballroom dance experience?</h3>
    <p>Certainly not!  You can still join any of our groups without knowing a thing.  You only need an interest.  In fact, most people who join us every semester have never danced before.</p>
    <h3>Do I need to bring a partner?</h3>
    <p>Not at all!  We rotate partners throughout lessons, so you will dance with many people.</p>
    <h3>What is the difference between a practice and a lesson?</h3>
    <p>Lessons are structured group classes taught by an instructor, while practices are unstructured informal times meant to work on lesson material.</p>
    <h3>Do I need any special clothing or shoes?</h3>
    <p>Nope, just come with comfortable clothing and shoes.  Many in the Ballroom/Latin and Argentine Tango tracks dance with their socks on, while soft-soled sneakers like Converses are popular in the Lindy Hop track.  If you have ballroom dance shoes, however, feel free to wear them!</p>
    <h3>I am not a student or affiliated with RPI. Can I still join?</h3>
    <p>Of course!  Our lessons and practices are open to everyone.  We draw a fair number of non-RPI people every semester.</p>
    <h3>Where and how do I sign up?</h3>
    <p>Just come to a lesson and let us know at the door or you can <a href="<?php echo($PAGE_PATH);?>contact">email us</a>!  Watch the home page or <a href="<?php echo($PAGE_PATH);?>news" title="">news page</a> for announcements about the first lessons of the semester.</p>
