<h1>Rules</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Competitors may dance at adjacent levels in different styles but may not span more than 2 levels. For example - registering for Silver Smooth and Bronze Latin is fine but registering for Gold Smooth and Bronze Latin is not. If a dance is not offered at the level you are competing, you may dance up for that dance (e.g. a Newcomer dancer can dance Silver Viennese Waltz since it it not offered at a lower level).</li>
  <p></p>
  <li>Double registration (i.e. registering for subsequent levels in the same style) is allowed.
    <ul>
      <li>&bull; Couples must dance at the level of the higher competitor (i.e. if the Follower is Bronze, and the Leader is Silver, the couple must dance at the Silver level and have the option of double registering to also compete at the Gold level, if they so desire).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Level Eligability:
    <ul>
      <li>&bull; Newcomer: Have not danced prior to the Spring 2017 semester.</li>

      <li>&bull; Syllabus events are open to all competitors.</li>
